Photosynthetic parameters were measured using a MultiSpeQ instrument with PhotosynQ v2. Platform. 
The photosynthesis RIDES protocol was used to measure quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Î¦PSII) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) estimated using the NPQt method and thus designated NPQt (Tietz et al., 2017). 
ECSt, representing the magnitude of the pmf formed in the light, was used to estimate conductivity of ATP synthase (gH+) and light driven proton fluxes (vH+) using DIRK analysis (Sacksteder and Kramer, 2000; Kanazawa and Kramer, 2002). 
Data cleaning was performed using code from a GitHub repository (https://github.com/protonzilla/Light-Potentials-in-Field) as described (Kanazawa et al., 2021).
