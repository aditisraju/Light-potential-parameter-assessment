Photosynthetic parameters were assessed using a MultiSpeQ device in conjunction with PhotosynQ v2. platform. The photosynthesis RIDES protocol was employed to measure quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Î¦PSII) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) estimated via the NPQt method, denoted as NPQt (Tietz et al., 2017). ECSt, indicating the extent of pmf created under light, was utilized to evaluate ATP synthase conductivity (gH+) and light-driven proton fluxes (vH+) using DIRK analysis (Sacksteder and Kramer, 2000; Kanazawa and Kramer, 2002). Data cleaning was conducted as outlined in Kanazawa et al. (2021).
